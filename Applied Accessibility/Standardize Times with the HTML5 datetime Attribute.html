<!--
Continuing with the date theme, HTML5 also introduced the time element along with a datetime attribute to standardize times.
This is an inline element that can wrap a date or time on a page. A valid format of that date is held by the datetime attribute.
This is the value accessed by assistive devices. It helps avoid confusion by stating a standardized version of a time, even if it's written in an informal or colloquial manner in the text.

Here's an example:

<p>Master Camper Cat officiated the cage match between Goro and Scorpion <time datetime="2013-02-13">last Wednesday</time>,
which ended in a draw.</p>

Camper Cat's Mortal Kombat survey results are in! Wrap a time tag around the text "Thursday, September 15<sup>th</sup>"
and add a datetime attribute to it set to "2016-09-15".
