<!--
Instead of using em or px to size text, you can use viewport units for responsive typography.
Viewport units, like percentages, are relative units, but they are based off different items.
Viewport units are relative to the viewport dimensions (width or height) of a device, and percentages are relative to the size of the parent container element.

The four different viewport units are:

    vw: 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
    vh: 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
    vmin: 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height vs. width).
    vmax: 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height vs. width).

Set the width of the h2 tag to 80% of the viewport's width and the width of the paragraph as 75% of the viewport's smaller dimension.
