<!--
We just proved that browsers read CSS from top to bottom.
That means that, in the event of a conflict, the browser will use whichever CSS declaration came last.

But we're not done yet. There are other ways that you can override CSS. Do you remember id attributes?

Let's override your pink-text and blue-text classes, and make your h1 element orange, by giving the h1 element an id and then styling that id.

Give your h1 element the id attribute of orange-text. Remember, id styles look like this:

<h1 id="orange-text">

Leave the blue-text and pink-text classes on your h1 element.

Create a CSS declaration for your orange-text id in your style element. Here's an example of what this looks like:

    #brown-text {
      color: brown;
    }

Note: It doesn't matter whether you declare this CSS above or below pink-text class, since id attribute will always take precedence.
